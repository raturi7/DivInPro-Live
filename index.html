                    <p>
                    The increasing rate of domestic violence or even other forms of violence, whether off or on the record, has increased
                    alarmingly, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic had forced families to stay in and in whatever
                    conditions that they were subjected to. The violence against women has not been limited to domestic households in
                    our country. India has seen violence against forms so horrific- from the Nirbhaya rape case in 2012 to the Hatteras
                    rape case in 2020- enough has been seen and done!
                    <br>
                
                    Even on the International level, violence against women has been increasing at an alarming rate. According to the UN
                    report “COVID 19 and ending violence against women and girls”, as many as 243 million girls and women were subjected
                    to abuse by their initiate partners and not more than 40% came forward to seek justice or help.

                    <b>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO “ORANGE THE WORLD”?</b>
                    <br><br>
                
                    To spread awareness and sensitization towards the issue, the United Nations celebrates 25th Nov as the
                    “international day for the Elimination of Violence against Women”. Under the 16-day campaign between 25th Nov and
                    10th Dec, the campaign called “Orange the World” is also included. The color “orange” signifies freedom and fosters
                    a sense of unity, and gives us hope for a brighter tomorrow that is free from violence for everyone. This day acts
                    as a means of communicating that together if we stand united, we can contribute towards eliminating all forms of
                    violence. In the past, the United Nations has shown their solidarity and their contribution by illuminating the
                    UNESCO globe in orange, organizing an exhibition showing the depth and scope of violence against girls and women,
                    and calling for a social campaign to spread awareness and advocate for women rights. During this time, social media
                    saw a flood of posts with the hashtags #OrangeTheWorld #25Nov #IDEVAW.

                    <b>HIGHLIGHTS OF THE LAST YEAR:</b>
                    <br><br>

                    In the year 2020, the UN campaign aimed to amplify the call for global action to support the domestic violence
                    survivors during the lockdown, collection of data, and to make efforts to prevent more instances of domestic
                    violence across the globe. During these 16 days, the mics were handed over to the survivors- who share their stories
                    and inspire millions of other lives out there. Stories and instances were shared from across the globe about how
                    things worsened with the onset of the pandemic and what actions these brave ladies took to protect themselves and
                    come out stronger.

                    <br><br>
                
                    This year will mark the 30th year since the campaign was first started by the United Nations in 1991. Over the
                    years, as many as 6000 organizations from over 187 countries have participated and over 3000 million people have
                    contributed to the campaign.

                    In 2021, the United Nations is celebrating the international day for the Elimination of Violence against Women
                    through virtual mode. This webinar is kept open for the general public to attend, and allows us, as humans, to
                    question the root causes of violence against our girls and women. Ms. Tatiana Makaira Bandelier will get into a
                    conversation with the moderator and talk about her book “beyond our tears” a book that highlights the struggles and
                    testimonies which motivate us and will also encourage us.

                    Women in India and across the globe have been subjected to violence in all forms- from physical and domestic to
                    emotional and psychological violence. However, this year at DivIn Pro, we are here to appreciate the survivors and
                    show our solidarity with our sisters. The DivIn Pro team stands together for and with our women!

                    <h1>CELEBRATING CHILDREN AND NOT JUST THE DAY</h1>
                    <p>Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had a similar vision of children at the pedestal of
                        nation-building. Due to his immense love and faith towards children and their unending potential
                        to rise and lead, India celebrates Children's Day with utmost pride and joy on the 14th of
                        November every year as this day also marks his birth anniversary. We all know that the planet is
                        going through a lot in almost all aspects of life, especially after the covid-19 pandemic. It
                        has resulted in unprecedented changes in our children's life. Let us grab the opportunity today
                        to have a look at these multifaceted changes that have impacted the lives of our
                        children.<br /><br />

                        <b>CHILDCARE AND PARENTING</b>
                        <br />
                        Parents and their roles of parenting have become challenging to handle all the tasks be it
                        office, child care, and household chores, all are happening in the same space and at the same
                        time. All this has rendered women of households highly burdened. Homes are now centres of
                        learning, offices, recreation place, and much more. Lockdowns brought children to get to spend
                        more time at home but not all the houses have separate rooms and space for multiple purposes
                        they get less space and freedom in their own house. Parents find it difficult to manage multiple
                        roles with limited space and time and with limited technology resources.
                        <br /><br />
                        <b>FUN AND RECREATION</b>
                        <br />
                        Overburdened parents and distressed children of the pandemic period found virtual babysitters,
                        childminders, and child engagement programs as a big rescue. Again, our virtuous problem-solvers
                        following the global trend stood up for providing virtual hobby classes and recreation sessions
                        to the children. Such initiatives are helping our children to explore much of their interests
                        and potential at such a tender age all in a fun and joyous manner. Platforms like Mumbai-based
                        startup - ProEves are bringing teachers and caregivers, especially those who became unemployed
                        during pandemic together in this situation of adversity making much out of our diverse little
                        nation builders.<br /><br />

                        <b>EDUCATION</b>
                        <br />
                        Just like parenting and child care, education for children has also taken a deep turn into an
                        entirely new era of virtual learning in India. With online classes being a new normal, many new
                        startups are emerging to fill the void created by the learning crisis caused by the pandemic.
                        Startups like Doubtnut and Practically are reaching out to helpless children to clear their
                        doubts and concepts in the absence of brick and mortar school guidance. But, the situation is
                        not at all rosy. Nearly 35 lakh children in India are 'out of school' as per Government of India
                        data with insights provided by the States (Economic Times, October 2021). There is much to do to
                        build the digital ecosystem of our country keeping in view the huge digital divide and rising
                        student suicide cases for not being able to cope up with studies during the
                        pandemic.<br /><br />

                        <b>CAREER AND FUTURE PLANS</b>
                        <br />
                        Along with change in the learning and education ecosystem, the changing economy and market
                        conditions are demanding from children to have a robust career plan. Good future planning for
                        family, career, and lifestyle is a necessity in today's world. So, opting for a sound career of
                        choice and interest is a matter of concern for both parents and children. To overcome this, many
                        children look up to career counsellors and experts for one-on-one guidance and counselling.
                        These children-cum-adults get insights on emerging employment options, the feasibility of their
                        future career plans, financial and educational consulting from these experts. Consultants and
                        relevant agencies guide them to available noble options on scholarships, government schemes,
                        programs- free, partially paid, and affordable academic training and coaching, etc. that might
                        help them to realise their career dreams. It is also encouraging to see that not just parents
                        but children on their own are rising to explore career plans for themselves. Neither are they
                        shy to seek help from the established leaders nor do their parents seek self-dependence out of
                        false ego. Many out-of-the-box startups solving contemporary and age-old problems. <br /><br />

                        <b>CHILD’S CARE, SAFETY AND WELL-BEING</b>
                        <br />
                        We would all agree to the fact that being a child is not as easy as adults have considered. Too
                        much insight and expectations from parents, teachers, peers, and society can harm rather than do
                        good to their overall well-being. Children, as they become a replica of what they see around
                        themselves, tend to attain undesired traits and habits like getting irritated often, not being
                        able to express, confidence issues, mood swings, and simply getting lazy and depressed. Though
                        sometimes considered normal, these issues are most of the time result of some serious underlying
                        factor. As per the State of the World's Children 2021 report, 14% of youth in India (among 15 to
                        25 years of age) reported "feeling depressed". To address the issue, the Central Government and
                        many state governments have come up with stringent child safety laws, schemes, and dedicated
                        helpline numbers. But we need a more personalized and customised approach to communicate to them
                        on a case-to-case basis. For this also, the market is coming up with many
                        innovations.<br /><br />

                        Children have an immense role to play to build a better world. They are the biggest contributors
                        to our nation's joy, growth, and prosperity. Not every child has the luxury of a laptop or
                        internet or even a complete nourishing diet, it is our duty to reach out to the children who are
                        unfortunately underprivileged, abused, or denied of their rights.<br /><br />

                        Let's Pledge to make our world a better place to live by nurturing children who are builders of
                        the beautiful tomorrow.<br /><br />

                    <h1>Battling Breast Cancer</h1>
                    <p>Cancer is a bunch of infections in which abnormal cells divide uncontrollably and devastate the
                        body tissue. As per WHO, it is the leading cause of death worldwide. In India, it accounts for
                        around 8 lakh deaths every year. Contrary to worldwide trends, Indian women's cancer patients
                        exceed in number as compared to their male counterparts. Women are generally affected by cervix,
                        uterine, ovary, and oral cancer with breast cancer being more impactful and alone making up 27%
                        of total cancer cases (Globocan Report, 2018).<br /><br />

                        <b>Causal factors of breast cancer</b>

                        support mechanisms provided by the government and certain civil society organizations.<br />
                        • Hesitancy to inquire experts, especially in the case of male practitioners due to disgrace,
                        embarrassment, or fear of societal judgments.<br />
                        • Resource crunches and time constraints from the side of treatment providers and the engaged
                        stakeholders.<br />
                        • Genetic and hereditary factors and others<br />
                        • Lifestyle choices like sedentary schedule, smoking and substance abuse, consumption of oral
                        contraceptives without clinical advice.<br /><br />

                        <b>ROLE OF EMERGING STARTUPS IN FIGHTING AND WINNING CANCER</b>
                        <br />
                        Dealing with something like cancer and fighting it is a dreadful nightmare anyone can go
                        through. And the entire cancer journey becomes a unique experience for women in whose case
                        elements of shame, embarrassment, demanding social pressure, and beauty standards creep in.
                        Scientific communities and technologies are advancing on an unprecedented scale to make the
                        disease curable and reduce the fatalities caused by it.<br />

                        Fortunately, certain noble social entrepreneurs are rising for the cause of cancer care and
                        awareness especially to reach out to the underprivileged women in the country. Some are making
                        women aware of the symptoms, available treatments, and post-treatment options.
                        Many through social media campaigns and in situ campaigns are also taking up for the noble cause
                        of raising awareness among the ladies of remote corners of the country.<br />

                        Many rising startups like 'Niramai' and 'OncoStem Diagnosis' are engaged in early detection of
                        the infection(former working specifically for breast cancer screening).<br />
                        Some are even daring to enter the domain of manufacturing to supply affordable and comfortable
                        breast prosthetics in differing sizes suiting the need of Indian women of all ages.<br /><br />


                        <b>CONSULTATION AND COMMUNICATION THROUGH CALL CENTRES</b>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The emerging cancer care fabric is commendable in India. Time and again we are seeing the rise
                        of volunteers to change the picture of cancer care especially for women. But just dispensing
                        information on the internet and setting up detention centres won't be enough.
                        There is an urgent need for 'communication' with individual sufferers, consulting their issues
                        and personalised treatment at each stage, be it awareness, detection, treatment, or
                        post-treatment.<br /><br />

                        Consultation facilities for cancer patients are available in the medical consultation market but
                        they are mostly confined to the medical aspects of cancer only. Women tend to miss sharing their
                        minds and emotional pain with counselors. The absence of such patient care services leaves women
                        distressed when they can't express properly what they are going through, especially when it
                        comes to breast and vaginal cancer.<br /><br />

                        A robust consultation and consultative mechanism composed entirely of women folks can be a
                        game-changer. Female sufferers not just need diagnosis advice, they also need someone who can
                        listen to their issues coming in the way of recovery, like lack of financial or family support,
                        mental and intimate body issues, and provide valuable insights for solving the same.<br /><br />

                        So, easing the scenario for cancer care delivery is achievable. Before dealing with cancer
                        within the body, we have to deal with the cancer of miscommunication, social stigma, and
                        unawareness associated with it.<br /><br />

                        Cancer is not just a somatic disease rather it has psychological implecations and challenges. To
                        deal with such a dreadful disase, we as responsible citizens must create an ecosystem that
                        supports ailing people and the medical fraternity with effective patient communication and
                        support systems so that we together may fight back and win the battle of life.<br /><br />

                    <h1>HOME STAYS: ENRICHING THE TRAVEL EXPERIENCE</h1>

                    <p>
                        With rapid urbanization, the modern world has also seen changing life and traveling patterns
                        among the younger
                        generations. The people today are not just interested in exploring the places they visit but
                        they are also willing to
                        take a deep dive into the culture and traditions on their tours. The best way to indulge in the
                        rawness of a place, its
                        culture, and its traditions is by getting involved with the local population on a personal
                        level.
                        <br>
                        One way to establish that connection could be to enjoy the home stays. The concept of homestays
                        is a relatively new one
                        in our country which allows travelers to stay with the locals in their homes, get accustomed to
                        their routines, and
                        learn new patterns. In her BlogPriyanka explains how homestay experiences can be beautiful as
                        well as exhausting in some
                        cases. As a traveler, she explains that staying at homestay is the best way to get a deeper
                        understanding of the people,
                        the culture, the traditions, and the customs. She goes on to explain how the homestays work- you
                        get to stay as per the
                        family norms, you are taken care of and you get local recommendations (the best way to start
                        exploring a new place).
                        Moreover, homestays add a more personal touch to your journey unlike a stay at the hotel/hostel-
                        where you check-in,
                        stay and check out.
                        More recently, the trend of homestays has seen a rise in our country. Families who have an
                        interest in hosting
                        foreigners or domestic travelers or who have an extra room to rent out have started functioning
                        as Stay-homes too.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>The First Stay-Home Scheme in India</b>
                        <br>
                        The first-ever Short Stay Home Scheme in India was launched in the year 1969 to provide
                        rehabilitation services,
                        accommodation, and maintenance to women who have been left homeless due to issues like Domestic
                        Violence, Intimate
                        partner violence, or victims of mal-adjustments, etc. The United Nations Scheme provides for
                        medical and psychiatric
                        treatment, therapy, education, and counseling of such women and girls.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>The National Level Scheme on Stay Homes</b>
                        <br>
                        The National Homestay Scheme aims to provide an affordable and clean staying place for the
                        foreigner & domestic tourists
                        while also allowing the tourists to stay with the Indian families, get accustomed to their
                        traditions and customs, and
                        enjoy authentic Indianism. The scheme divides the Stay-homes into two categories: silver and
                        gold and such
                        classification will be made by the Regional Classification Committee.
                        The deciding factors for this classification would include the size of the home, the amenities,
                        etc. It further states
                        the fees to be deposited by the applicants under each category for their registrations.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>The Uttarakhand Homestay Scheme</b>
                        <br>
                        The Deendayal Upadhyaya Grah Awas Yojna was launched by the Government of Uttarakhand in 2018 to
                        develop homestays in
                        the State to improve the economic condition of the people, to introduce the tourists to the
                        culture, and to reduce
                        migration by creating employment opportunities locally.
                        This scheme further lays down the subsidy criteria, the terms and conditions, and the benefits
                        for the applicants as
                        well as the tourists.
                        <br>
                        However, one major issue that the Homestays face is due to the communication gap between the
                        tourists and the home-stay
                        owners before their arrival. The lack of communication could be due to various reasons including
                        lack of proper
                        infrastructure, which eventually impacts the quality of time that the guests have stayed at the
                        Home-stay.
                        At Divin ebiz, we are dedicated to solving these problems by taking acting as a mode of
                        communication between you and
                        your visitor, making sure all conversations are complete and the stay is as beautiful as the
                        tour!
                        <br><br>
                        <b>CONCLUSION:</b>
                        <br>
                        Whenever a traveler reaches a new city, the first thing they need is a place to stay- and if
                        that place is well
                        equipped, personal, and gives a homely feeling, nothing could match the feeling of that. The
                        concept of home-stays not
                        only helps the traveler to make the, best out of their trip but also ensures that the economic
                        development of the area
                        keeps growing. It generates income for the owner of the land and employment opportunities for
                        the locals, hence also
                        empowering a sense of confidence among the people.

                    <h1>CALL CENTERS: HELPING BUSINESSES GROW</h1>
                    <p>
                        Today, businesses find it difficult to keep a track of the increasing demands of customers;
                        these
                        customer-centric demands shall be met with quality interactions, immediate responses, and timely
                        results. The whole process becomes difficult for businesses as they can’t employ enough to
                        handle
                        such operations that require them to focus on core business operations and interact with the
                        customers at the same time. The most reliable and tested solution is Business Process
                        Outsourcing
                        (BPO)/call centers across sectors globally that help deliver desired value to the existing
                        customer
                        base and also help companies to form new customers and new markets.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Need and relevance of BPO for businesses</b>
                        <br>
                        Call centers are primarily used for customer service, sales, setting appointments with clients,
                        collecting customer feedback, market research, and following up on the customers. Call centers,
                        if
                        established internally, may become a huge economic burden. Hence, a third-party vendor or a
                        service
                        provider is hired to manage customer service tasks. This is a relatively economical and more
                        impactful deal for a business as the service provider is responsible for the infrastructure
                        management, technological implementations, and resource management that are required to set up
                        and
                        run a call center. The cumbersome process of setting up the complete infrastructure and human
                        resource management like recruiting, hiring, and training of the agents would all be resolved by
                        the
                        service provider.

                        A business process outsourcing call center has several advantages such as- <br>

                    functions that requires constant attention and highly specialized services which most of the time
                    becomes difficult for companies to manage. Hence the most progressive, visionary, and
                    customer-focused organizations outsource their customer service operations to a dedicated call
                    center or a third-party vendor who handles their customer services so that companies may focus and
                    grow upon their core business operations.

                                                rest of the DivIn Pro team work incredibly hard and diligently to
                                                achieve the mission. We wish DivIn Pro continued success in their future
                                                endeavors and aspire to work with them in the future to have more
                                                positive impacts on society.
